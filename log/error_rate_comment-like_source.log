This is a logbook of the output of the three tests we did
for the understanding of error rate of randomly sampled pairs, as well the following
1) the error rate of those that violates nUNA
2) the error rate of those that violates qUNA
3) the error rate of those that violates iUNA

=== the first output ===
number of files examined:  28
number of entities:  8394
number of edges:  119665
total edges generated:  119665
total correct edges:  38142
total error edges:  56210

correct rate    0.3187
error rate    0.4697
the error rate is therefore between    0.4697
and     0.6813


 nUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates nUNA:  51154
total correct edges:  27477
total error edges:  16712

correct rate    0.5371
error rate    0.3267
the error rate is therefore between    0.3267
and     0.4629


 qUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates qUNA:  33947
total correct edges:  17352
total error edges:  11119

correct rate    0.5111
error rate    0.3275
the error rate is therefore between    0.3275
and     0.4889


 iUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates iUNA:  339
total correct edges:  264
total error edges:  29

correct rate    0.7788
error rate    0.0855
the error rate is therefore between    0.0855
and     0.2212


== the second output ==
number of files examined:  28
number of entities:  8394
number of edges:  119665
total edges generated:  119665
total correct edges:  37949
total error edges:  56532

correct rate    0.3171
error rate    0.4724
the error rate is therefore between    0.4724
and     0.6829


 nUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates nUNA:  50762
total correct edges:  26904
total error edges:  16888

correct rate    0.5300
error rate    0.3327
the error rate is therefore between    0.3327
and     0.4700


 qUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates qUNA:  33580
total correct edges:  17061
total error edges:  11013

correct rate    0.5081
error rate    0.3280
the error rate is therefore between    0.3280
and     0.4919


 iUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates iUNA:  365
total correct edges:  286
total error edges:  34

correct rate    0.7836
error rate    0.0932
the error rate is therefore between    0.0932
and     0.2164

== the third run ===
number of files examined:  28
number of entities:  8394
number of edges:  119665
total edges generated:  119665
total correct edges:  38225
total error edges:  56238

correct rate    0.3194
error rate    0.4700
the error rate is therefore between    0.4700
and     0.6806


 nUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates nUNA:  50541
total correct edges:  26784
total error edges:  16817

correct rate    0.5299
error rate    0.3327
the error rate is therefore between    0.3327
and     0.4701


 qUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates qUNA:  33418
total correct edges:  16988
total error edges:  10975

correct rate    0.5083
error rate    0.3284
the error rate is therefore between    0.3284
and     0.4917


 iUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates iUNA:  364
total correct edges:  292
total error edges:  32

correct rate    0.8022
error rate    0.0879
the error rate is therefore between    0.0879
and     0.1978
