This is a logbook of the output of the three tests we did
for the understanding of error rate of randomly sampled pairs, as well the following
1) the error rate of those that violates nUNA
2) the error rate of those that violates qUNA
3) the error rate of those that violates iUNA
--- the first output ---
number of files examined:  28
number of entities:  8394
number of edges:  119665
total edges generated:  119665
total correct edges:  38082
total error edges:  56293

correct rate    0.3182
error rate    0.4704
the error rate is therefore between    0.4704
and     0.6818


 nUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates nUNA:  73920
total correct edges:  37023
total error edges:  24672

correct rate    0.5009
error rate    0.3338
the error rate is therefore between    0.3338
and     0.4991


 qUNA

correct rate    0.4797
error rate    0.3352
the error rate is therefore between    0.3352
and     0.5203


 iUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates iUNA:  917

error rate    0.0589
the error rate is therefore between    0.0589
and     0.3784

error rate    0.3324
the error rate is therefore between    0.3324
and     0.5178


 iUNA

total edges generated:  119665
total edges generated that violates iUNA:  944
total correct edges:  614
